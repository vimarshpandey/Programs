             \India that has a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning 
             in the Hindu world.[15][b] The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship
              that underpins its religious tourism.[18] Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the
               southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of 
               the river. <font class="text-danger">It is 692 kilometres(430 mi) to the southeast

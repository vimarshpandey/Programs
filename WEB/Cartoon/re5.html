                Tom & Jerry is an animated cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks.
                The longtime mascot of The Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically
                wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves. Taking inspiration from silent film
                personalities such as Charlie Chaplin's Tramp, Mickey is traditionally characterized as a
                sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity.[2] The characterâ€™s status as a small
                mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was
                originally provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally
                acclaimed fictional characters of all time.

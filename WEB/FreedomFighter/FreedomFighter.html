          was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[6] who participated in the murder of a British police officer[7]\
          in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely
          symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the
          back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab
          region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[9] Borrowing
          ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a growing militancy in India
          in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent 
          but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.[15</div>
